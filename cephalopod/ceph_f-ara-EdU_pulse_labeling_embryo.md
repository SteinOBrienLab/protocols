## Setup

### Prepare Stock Solutions
#### f-ara-EdU (10mM stock in DMSO)
- F-ara-EdU (2′S)-2′-Deoxy-2′-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine, (Sigma #T511293)
  - Add 2 ml of DMSO or PBS to vial containing 5 mg f-ara-EdU to make a 10 mM stock solution. 
  - After being dissolved, remaining f-ara-EdU stock solution is stable for up to 1 year when stored at −20 °C. 
  - f-ara-EdU solution should be portioned into single use aliquots to avoid freeze thawing. 
  - <span class='caution'>CAUTION:</span> EdU is incorporated into DNA and is a potential mutagen. Proper protective clothing should be used when handling EdU. Waste, including stock solutions, used media and water containing f-ara-EdU should be considered as hazardous.

#### Click-iT reaction buffer (Component D)
- Prepare a working solution of 1X Click-iT® EdU reaction buffer (Component D):
  - Transfer the solution (4 mL) in the Component D bottle to 36 mL of deionized water.
  - To make smaller amounts of 1X Click-iT® EdU reaction buffer, dilute volumes from the Component D bottle 1:10 with deionized water. After use, store any remaining 1X solution at 2–8˚C. When stored as directed, this 1X solution is stable for 6 months.

#### Click-iT buffer additive (Component F)
- To make a 10X stock solution of the Click-iT® EdU buffer additive (Component F): Add
    - 2 mL deionized water to the vial, then mix until fully dissolved. 
- After use, store any remaining stock solution at ≤–20˚C.
- When stored as directed, this stock solution is stable for up to 1 year.
- If the solution develops a brown color, it has degraded and should be discarded.

### Materials
- 1.5 ml Microcentrifuge tubes (clear)
- Rocker
- Staining vials
- Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit (ThermoFisher #C10640)


### Buffers

## Protocol
### f-ara-EdU Pulse Labeling
1. Collect embryos or larvae at the desired stage.
2. Dechorionate embryos in Filtered Natural Sea Water or ASW.
3. Transfer embryos or larvae into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube or multi-well plate (e.g. 24-well plate). 
   - If using a plate, you may need to pre-coat with 0.2% agarose to prevent embryos from sticking and allowing for chorion expansion.
4. To optimize labeling efficiency and minimize toxicity, you can set up a test matrix of different concentrations and durations of f-ara-EdU labeling.
   - Include cultures treated with vehicle alone for controls.

| | 30 min | 60 min | 120 min | 24 h |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1µM| | | | |
|10µM| | | | |
|100µM| | | | |

1. Add appropriate volume of f-ara-EdU DMSO stock solution (10mM stock) to achieve desired final concentration.
   - For example, to achieve a final concentration of 10µM in 1ml of ASW, add 1µl of 10mM f-ara-EdU stock solution.
2. Incubate embryos in f-ara-EdU solution at 18°C in the dark.

### Fixation
1. Fix embryos for 1h-overnight in 4% PFA in sea water at 4°C in glass vial.
  - Can be left for up to 4 days?
2. Wash embryos in PBS-T
  - 2x 5 min
  - 3x 30 min
3. Remove PBS-T and add High-SDS HYB (~5x volume of embryos).
4. Wait for embryos to settle to the bottom of the vial.
5. <span class="pause">PAUSE POINT:</span> Store at -20ºC

### Click-iT Plus f-ara-EdU Fluorescent Labeling and Detection
1. Allow Click-iT kit components to come to room temperature before opening.
2. Prepare a working solution of fluorescent azide for EdU detection by adding 130 μl of DMSO to Component B of the kit (Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 647, or Pacific Blue) and mix well. 
  - Any remaining working solution will be stable for a year if stored at ≤−20 °C.
3. Add 2 ml of deionized water to the vial containing the Click-iT EdU buffer additive (Component G) to make a 10× stock solution and gently mix until fully dissolved. 
  - Any remaining stock solution should be dispensed into single use aliquots and is stable for a year when stored at ≤−20 °C.
4. Prepare a master mix of the components required for the Click-it reaction. For each tube mix together 438 μl PBS or TBS, 10 μl CuSO4 (Component F), 2.5 μl fluorescent azide (prepared in Subheading 3.5, step 1), 50 μl 10× reaction buffer additive (prepared in Subheading 3.5, step 2). Scale up the mixture for the number of samples to be treated and add 500 μl to each tube. It is important to use the cocktail within 15 min of preparation. It is good practice to include a control sample of cells not exposed to EdU. In addition, these cells are needed for single staining compensation controls for intracellular antigens or antigens stained with RPE, PE-tandem, or Qdot antibody conjugates.
5. Incubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
6. Add 3 ml of the Click-iT permeabilization and wash buffer.
7. Decant the supernatant.
