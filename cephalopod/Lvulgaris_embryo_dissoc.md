## Reagents

### Papain enzyme solution
- Papain (Sigma #P3125)
- Concentration 1 mg/ml in nuclease-free PBS


## Protocol
1. Embryos were first dissected out of their eggs in stages 28–30 (pre-hatchling stage) and their heads were isolated and put in nuclease-free phosphate buffer (PBS) on ice. The heads were then
2.  Centrifuge for 5 min at 4°C
3.  Carefully remove supernatant and replace with papain enzyme solution
solution 
1. Incubate tissue for 30 min at room temperature (20–25°C) under continuous agitation. 
   - During the incubation period, gently triturate up and down every 10 min to facilitate dissociation. 
1. Centrifuge cell suspension at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. 
1. Remove supernatant replace with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to stop the enzymatic reaction. 
1. Repeate previous wash step one more time to ensure removal of the enzyme. 
1. Filter suspension through a 40 μm Flowmi Cell strainer (Bel-Art H13680-0040).
1. Spin at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. 
1. Discard supernatant, and resuspend cells in 100 μl of
PBS + 0.04% BSA with added RNAse inhibitor (0.1 μL/ml) and gently
pipette the entire volume approximately 200 times to ensure dissociation.
1. Assess cell concentration and viability via countess or similar method with PI or Acridine Orange (AO) assay.
