## Protocol

### Embryo collection and fixation

<span class="timing">TIMING: ~2h</span>

1. Fix embryos overnight in 4% PFA in sea water at 4°C in glass vial.

- Can be left for up to 4 days

2. Warm up High-SDS HYB to 37ºC to resuspend SDS.
3. Wash embryos in PBS-T

- 2x 5 min
- 3x 30 min

4. Remove PBS-T and add High-SDS HYB (~5x volume of embryos).
5. Wait for embryos to settle to the bottom of the vial.
6. <span class="pause">PAUSE POINT:</span> Store at -20ºC

### Day 1

<span class="timing">TIMING: ~1h</span>

##### Preparation

1. Warm water bath (or hyb oven) to 37ºC.
2. Warm MI HYB to 37ºC.
3. Thaw vials with fixed embryos at room temperature.

#### Prepare Probe Solution

- The probe solution (prepared in MI HYB) should be a total of 150µl per hyb/eppendorf tube.
- If you have multiple samples with the same probe combination, you can prepare a mastermix

1. Prepare as follows
    - For each probe: 3µL of each probeset (from 1µM working stock) * $n_{samples}$
    - For MI HYB: (150µL - (3µL *# probesets))* $n_{samples}$
    - Final probe concentration should be 20nM
1. Vortex and spin down to collect
2. Incubate probe solution at 37ºC until embryos are ready.

#### Adding probe solution to embryos

1. Transfer 2-3 embryos into a 2ml Eppendorf tube.
2. Remove remaining High-SDS HYB.
3. Add 200µL of MI HYB
4. Incubate for ≥30 min at 37ºC.
5. Remove MI HYB solution and add 150µL probe solution.
6. Incubate overnight at 37ºC.

### Day 2

#### Preparation

1. Warm probe wash buffer to 37ºC.
2. Warm Amplification Buffer to room temperature (Not 37ºC)

#### Washes

1. Remove probe solution from embryos
    - Save probes in a labeled tube and store at -20ºC for reuse
2. Wash embryos in 400µL warm probe wash buffer at 37ºC.
    - 2x 5 min
    - 2x 15 min
    - 2x 30 min
3. Wash embryos in 1mL warm probe wash buffer at 37ºC for 1h
    - In the meantime, [prepare the hairpins](#prepare-hairpins)
4. Remove samples from water bath/heat block
    - Set hyb oven temp to 25ºC
5. Wash embryos in 500µL 5x SSCT at room temp.
    - 2x 5 min
6. Incubate embryos in 500µL Amplification Buffer at room temperature for ≥20min.

#### Prepare Hairpins

1. Set heat block to 95ºC.
2. Prepare hairpin mix:
    - Place 3µL * $n_{samples}$ of each hairpin (make sure to have h1 and h2 for each channel) in a tube
3. Heat shock hairpins at 95ºC for 90 sec.
4. Place hairpins in a dark drawer for ≥30 min to anneal
5. Add 150µL * $n_{samples}$ of Amplification Buffer (room temp) to the hairpin mix.
6. Vortex briefly and spin down
7. Leave in the dark until needed.

#### Incubate embryos with hairpins

1. Remove Amplification Buffer from embryos
2. Add 150µL of hairpin solution
3. Incubate overnight at 25ºC.

### Day 3

1. Remove hairpins and store ina labeled tube at -20ºC (hairpins can be reused)
2. Wash embryos in 600µL 5x SSCT on rocker at room temp.
    - 2x 5 min
    - 2x 15 min
    - 2x 30 min (optional: add 1:1000 DAPI in the first 30 min wash)
3. Store embryos in 5x SSCT (**NOT PBS**) at 4ºC until imaging.
